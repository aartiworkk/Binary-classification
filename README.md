# Binary Image Classification: Dogs vs Cats (CNN Model)

A deep learning project that classifies images of dogs and cats using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
This project was implemented on the **Kaggle dogsVScats dataset** and demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation.

##  Project Overview
- **Objective:** Build a binary image classifier to distinguish between the features of dogs and cats.  
- **Dataset:** [dogsVScats – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogsvscats) .  
- **Approach:**
  - Preprocessed images (resizing, normalization, augmentation).
  - Designed a **custom CNN architecture** using TensorFlow/Keras.
  - Trained and validated model performance with GPU acceleration.
  - Evaluated accuracy and tested predictions on unseen images.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle, GitHub

## 📊 Results
- Achieved **XX% training accuracy** and **XX% validation accuracy**.  
- Model successfully classified test images as **Dog 🐶** or **Cat 🐱**.  
- Example predictions:  
  - `dog.1234.jpg → Dog`  
  - `cat.5678.jpg → Cat`  

*(Replace XX% with your actual results once finalized)*

## 🔮 Future Work
- Apply **transfer learning** with pretrained models (VGG16, ResNet, EfficientNet).  
- Deploy as a **Streamlit/Gradio web app** for interactive predictions.  
- Optimize hyperparameters for higher validation accuracy.
